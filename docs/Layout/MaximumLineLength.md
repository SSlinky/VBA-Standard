# Maximum Line Length

Limit all lines to a maximum of 80 characters.

Limiting the character width allows improved readability on a portrait monitor. It also allows for more than one file open side-by-side and a landscape monitor.

The character limit helps with code structure as it may force you to rethink your long lines of code.
