# Maximum Line Length

Limit all lines to a maximum of 80 characters.

Limiting the line width has the following benefits:

* Improves readability and maintainability.
* Allows the code to be easily viewed on a portrait monitor, and enables multiple files to be open side-by-side on a landscape monitor.
* It may help with version control, as some systems may have difficulty tracking changes to long lines of code.
* It can make debugging easier if fewer steps are being completed on one line.

Finally, limiting the width of your lines can improve the overall formatting and navigability of your code, especially in large or complex projects. This can improve your code structure as it may force you to rethink your long lines of code.
