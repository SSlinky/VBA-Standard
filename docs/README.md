# VBA Standard

This standard provides coding conventions for working with VBA. It was created by the moderators of r/VBA in response to a number of discussion posts on best practices and coding standards.

Code is read more often than it is written so it is important to write standard and easily human-digestible code. This standard attempts to bring consistency, and therefore readability, to VBA code. That being said, there are occasions where it makes more sense to ignore the suggestions in this standard. Use your own judgement.

If you have any suggestions or input, please feel free to send a mod mail to r/vba.
